Welcome to the introductory course for computer resources here at SCRI.  This course will cover a basic introduction to the SCRI Citrix environment and also will introduce you to basic tools in linux.  If you have a bad case of CLAS (command line aversion syndrome), then this course should help you get on the road to recovery.


# Introduction to Citrix:

### What is Citrix?

Citrix is a platform for having access to programs on many different machines. This allows a user to log in to any machine on the network and continue working on their projects without having to have the program installed on every machine. This is very useful for nurses and students who move between locations a lot. But why is this imporant?

### Why Citrix?

For most here at Research you likely avoid citrix like the plague and/or don't intentionally use it because of the old thought that citrix is bad. However when needed citrix provides a steady platform of available programs to help complete most work. This includes access to email, Microsoft Office, and share drives from home. Infact you can get access to log into your local machine via the citrix applications to utilize those programs specific to your computer!

### Using Citrix safely?

Most wouldn't guess that Citrix is actually being used by just shy of everyone. Almost all of the icons on your desktop, besides a select few, are populated when citrix loads. How you access citrix and how you save what you are working on makes the difference when it comes to citrix. Knowing how to use your citix can be the difference to having an important document and having to rebuild from scratch. So we will go over some of the safest ways you can use citrix to your advantage!



#### Citrix was determined to be a useful part of this Initiative in order to more accurately familiarize you with the tools at your disposal and how to safely use them.

To start off please ensure you have completed the following:

1.	You have logged on the PDN : Directionhistoric
2.	Navigated to https://desktops.seattlechildrens.org 
3.	Logged in with Gemalto using your pin or dongle
4.	Copied the Mobaxterm mobile app to your "O:\ Drive"

Terms you might hear in this lesson are: VDI, VDS, Virtual Machine, Virtual Computer, XenDesktop, and XenApp. These are important to mention so you understand the differences.

* VDI = Virtual Device Infrastructure really meaning a hardware device that runs a virtual machine.
* VDS= Virtual Desktop Session is a session accessing software on a server.
* ACL = Access Control List Enables/Denies Communication between Computers and Servers.
* Xenapp = Server that is pushing apps to your account.
* XenDesktop = Session loaded on VDI's and when you log into https://desktops.seattlehchildrens.org/
* Virtual Machine = Virtual Computer they are equal in meaning. It is a virtual computer running on a server off in a different location.

Using the "O:\ Drive" or your group share as a single point of access is the safest way to save and access data because it is not only accessible everywhere you go but it is also backed up. This cannot be stressed enough!


#### __Exercise C1:__ 
1.	Open "My Citrix Computer" From the desktop and pin it to the right of the screen. We will refer to this as "Citrix"
2.	Create a file called textfile1.txt on your "O:\ Drive"
3.	Open the "Computer" by Clicking Start > Computer and pin that Window to the left of your screen.
4.	Navigate to the text document on your "O:\ Drive" in the left Window which we will call your local machine.
5.	Try and drag it from your local machine to your Citrix.
a.	(Notice how there is a Denial symbol?) This is because you cannot transfer between your Local machine and Citrix. See Diagram 3
b.	Leave both Windows open for Exercise 2.


#### __Exercise C2:__ 
1.	Lower down the "local machine" window.
2.	Open "Microsoft Outlook 2010" from your desktop. Pin it to the left side of your screen.
3.	Locate the "Dummy Email" sent to you this morning. If you did not receive it let me know.
4.	Drag the "Dummy Email" from Outlook to your "O:\ Drive" on "Citrix"
a.	(Notice how it allowed you to transfer the email there?)
5.	Open a new email and drag the text document from your "O:\ Drive" on "Citrix" to the new email.
a.	(Notice how it attached properly?)
Citrix can talk to Citrix and local can talk to local. If you have ever struggled to attach that word document or important grant to your email and had trouble it is likely that you were trying to use a mixed environment scenario.


#### __Exercise C3:__ 
1.	Open both local and Citrix windows the same way as in Exercise 1. Local on the left, Citrix on the right.
2.	Navigate to the "Desktop" on both. 
a.	(Notice that the amount of icons is different on both?)
3.	Navigate to the "O:\ Drive" on your Citrix Desktop and Copy the "New Text File1.txt" that you saved earlier.
4.	Now Navigate back to the "Desktop" in the Citrix window as before and paste the "NewTextFile1.txt" 
5.	Close out of the Citrix window.
6.	Open "My Citrix Computer" Once again and navigate to the "Desktop"
a.	(Notice how there is no text document on the desktop?)

Saving to the Citrix Desktop (the one with fewer icons), and closing out will cause you to lose what was saved there. This is because the Citrix window desktop is not actually an existing folder. Saving to the "O:\ Drive" or a department share is the single safest way to protect your data.


# Computational Resources at SCRI

The Research Informatics Team is engaged in *transforming* the way SCRI interacts with and handles big data. Part of this initiative is providing access to more scientific computing resources. The first systems to come on a line are a pair of high performance linux workstations. Keeping with the theme of "transforming research", these machines have been unofficially dubbed the Autobots, and been given the aliases Sunstreaker and Sideswiper.

# Introduction to Linux: 

### What is Linux?  

Linux is a free open sourced operating system based on Unix.  It's technically not unix, but in practice it might as well be.  Unix is like a shark of the computer world in the sense that the basic design has been around forever and is still good for what it does.  It has not changed much because people are still finding it very useful and powerful to this day.

### Why do people use it?

People like unix because it is powerful and flexible tool for efficiently getting certain kinds of work done.  This is especially true for work that has never been done before or that requires the creation of customized work flows.  If this sounds familiar that's because this is the same kind of work that people often need to do to manage data in science.  And this is why so many scientists have found linux to be a useful platform for developing new work flows.  Everyone agrees that graphical interfaces can be nice.  But the odds that you will find one that already does exactly what your experiment needs get vanishingly small starting with the moment you do anything interesting.

A question that came up and that perhaps you have asked, "Is this really worth it? Why should I invest my time in learning Linux?" The answer to this topic could be a course all by itself. Let us just try to point out what we think are a few of the advantages

* Many of the 'industry standard' tools used to analyze today's data are only available in Linux. GATK, tophat, bwa, cufflinks, samtools, many of these are open source tools that are meant to be distributed for free. These tools aren't readily available outside of the command-line environment

* Fine control. Whenever you make a graphical user interface, it becomes very hard to expose all the options that the program is capable of in an easy way. Therefore, you usually make assumptions and lock in some defaults. At the command-line, you can more easily allow the user to specify parameters and gain fine control of the program.

* Modularity. With a command-line interface, you can string small programs together like Legos and build your own custom workflows and programs that work exactly the way you want them to.

* Reproducibility. When you use command-line and/or write scripts, you create a record of exactly what you did to your data. Anytime you re-run the commands you wrote, you will get the same result.

* Speed. In the short-term, it may seem like a huge investment of time and energy to learn how to work in this environment and use these tools. The payoff comes though when you can write scripts to automate many tasks that once required hours of tedious repetition. Also, with Linux, you can take better advantage of parallel processing to vastly speed up the processing time.

* Scale. Most of the files that you may encounter, such as fasta, fastq, bam, etc, are enormous. Although they are often just simple text documents, most desktop computers simply can't handle them, so there is no way to open them or even 'take a peak' inside them. Hopefully you have seen how that those simple tasks are quite trivial with Linux systems. Dealing with large files and scaling up your analyses are easy for Linux.


# An Introduction to the command line: 

> "An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age."

The command line is the main way that professional people interact with Unix.  You might be tempted to think that something so old cannot possibly be as good as a more modern graphical interface.  But the command line demonstrates how a simpler tool can often be superior to much more complicated solutions.  


### Lets start by logging you in:

To connect to a linux machine, one of the most common tools is `ssh` or 'secure shell'. You can use `ssh` to connect to a linux machine if you have permission to do so like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh user@hostname
```

Normally ssh is not the first command you would teach a new student of the linux command line, but in this case we want you to use this information to log into the sunstreaker machine so that we can get started.

### The prompt

When you first log in to a linux terminal, you will see (with various levels of consternation) the __command prompt__. Like the dashboard of a car, the command prompt may look slightly different depending on the system, but in general the prompt will look something like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
userid@hostname:/workingdirectory $
```
The __userid__ is the user name that is logged in to the system, in this case your SCH user id. The __hostname__ is the name of the computer you are logged into. Note that it is the real name of the computer, not the alias. Refer to the table in the Computational Resources section. The __working directory__,as the name implies, is the directory that you are currently worrking in (see the section on `pwd` below). The prompt ends with the `$` character and finally the cursor. 

One common early mistake is to assume that anytime you can see the cursor, you must be able to give the computer a command. Indeed, the system will let you type anything you want at the cursor, even if it is busy. If you do that, your command will not execute until the system finishes whatever it's last command was. You can know that the system is busy whenever you see the cursor, but not the command prompt. In other words: *unless you see the full command prompt in front of the cursor*, the system is busy and is not ready to take a command. 
 
Sometimes you may see other types of characters that look 'command prompt-ish': 

* `+` This character indicates that whatever command you entered is incomplete and the system is waiting for more information. You can either supply the missing information, or you can return to the command prompt by hitting `CTRL-c`.
* `>` or `>>>`. These characters often indicate that you have entered into a different scripting environment, such as python or R. If you find yourself with this prompt and you didn't mean to, you can return to the command prompt by hitting `CTRL-c`, `exit()`, or `quit()`.

### Directories, executables and files

Directories are for storing stuff, executables do things to stuff and files are stuff.  In Linux a full directory path will start with root and end with another `/` and use more `/`'s in between as separators for each subdirectory.  On most command lines directories will be colored to indicate that they are different from the files.  And in linux most executables are stored somewhere else, so you won't normally see those unless you are invoking them as commands.

### Root

One of the keys to working within Linux is understanding how the heirarchy of folders and directories is set up, and how to move around within that file structure. Let us take a moment to understand the Linux filesystem.

If you are used to interfacing with your computer via a graphical user interface such as Finder (Mac) or Windows Explorer (PC), the concept of a __root directory__ may be somewhat vague. The root directory is simply the most inclusive folder on the system, or in other words, the folder that contains all other folders and files. When working with the command line, no matter what system you use, you can designate an absolute path by describing its location relative to root. For Window's users, each disk drive has it's own root, for example `C:`, `D:`, etc. Unix based systems, including Mac OS X and Linux, have a single root designated simply by `/`.

### Home

__`/home`__ deserves a little special attention. __home__ is not to be confused with __root__. A home directory is merely a default location to store personal account settings and user-specific files. Note however, that home is not root. In Linux, your home directory is always located at `/home/username`. Because this is a common stop for so many functions, a convenient short hand is used to designate home: `~`.

Because `/home` belongs to you, it is one of the few places where you can explore and play around without crashing the system (usually). Because it has a convenient short cut when using `cd`, it is also a convenient place to create links to other locations in your system. It is a very tempting place to set up shop and store all of your data. After all, when you first log in to the system, this is where you land. Even in our exercises, we had you start dumping the example files here. Be aware though, that in our system, `/home` is not very big. __You only have 10 GB of space alloted to your `/home` directory.__ For that reason, while it is a good place to stash some small files that you want to persist on the system, you really don't want to store your actual data in `/home`. Below, we will discuss some better alternatives.

### Where am I? Using __`pwd`__

Your command prompt, by default, shows you the name of the directory where you are currently located. That's nice, but you can still feel lost unless you know where you are relative to root. This is how you know where you are:
 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pwd
```
```{bash, echo=FALSE}
cd ~
pwd
```
`pwd` means print working directory.  It will tell you where in the file system you are by giving you the full path starting with root. In this example, this shows me that I am currently in my home directory.

*Note: We said that the command prompt tells you where you are. Remember that `~` is linux short-hand for your home directory.*  

### What is in here? Using __`ls`__

The next question you might ask is what files are in my current directory? The command `ls` is used to list the contents of a directory.  

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls
```

This is listing the contents of your current directory, which if you are following along is likely your own home directory. If this is the first time you have logged in to the system, this command will probably not show you anything. That doesn't mean that it is empty however. There are probably a number of hidden files. A more detailed listing of a directories contents can be found by adding a __parameter__ or __flag__ to the `ls` command:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -a
```

From this view you can see a number of files that begin with a period: `.`. These are configuration files. As you get to be more comfortable with linux, you may choose to edit these files in order to customize your experience. For now, we will ignore them.

By default, `ls` lists the contents of your present working directory, or where you currently are. You could however list the contents of another directory:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls /data
```

### How do I go somewhere else? Using __`cd`__

`cd` means change directory.  You call that command followed by a single argument to indicate which directory you want to change to. So for example, if you wanted to go to the directory called `/data`, you would enter:

```{bash}
cd /data
pwd
```

Notice that when you do this, your command prompt changes to reflect the new location you are in.

### Some special symbols
This is a good time to mention a few special symbols that act as convenient linux shortcuts:

* `~`: We have already talked about how this is short-hand for __home__

* `.`: A single dot is short hand for __here__ meaning your present working directory

* `..`: Two dots is short-hand for __the parent directory__ or the directory above your current location.

* `/`: The forward slash designates __root__

Examples:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ~
ls .
ls ..
cd ../..
ls /
```

####  <span style="color:blue">__Exercise L1:__</span>
1. Using the `cd` command, navigate to your home directory. *Hint: your home directory is designated by `~`.*
2. Use the `pwd` to show the path do your home directory.
3. Use the `ls` command to see what files are in your home directory.
4. Use the `ls -a` command to see any hidden files in your home directory.
5. Use the `cd` command to move up a level to the parent directory of your home. *Hint: what is the short-hand for the parent directory of your location?*
6. Show the path to your current location.
7. Show the files that are in this current directory. Are there any hidden files?
8. Navigate up one more level from your current location. Show the path to this location. What is the name of this location? What files and directories are found here?
9. Navigate to the `/tools` directory. Look around at the contents of this directory. Try descending into a few of them and see what they contain. 
10. Return to your home directory. Can you do it with a very simple command?

### How do I know how to use a command? Using __`man`__ and __`--help`__

In Linux, half the battle is knowing what commands are available to use. That comes through experience and judicious use of Google. The other half is knowing how to use them. For that, one of your first resources is the `man` command, short for *manual*. You can use the `man` command to pull up a manual about any linux command like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
man ls
```

At first glance this may not seem too helpful. Admittedly, some man pages are definately more useful than others. Let's break down this page into it's components so you can understand how to use these pages.

First, how to navigate. `man` is opened in a special linux text reader called `less` (which we will visit in more detail later). Command-line interfaces were invented before the mouse and scroll bars, so you have to re-learn how to navigate with no mouse. Use the up and down arrows to scroll up and down line by line. When you want to exit, hit `q`. 

Now that you know how to move around inside the man page, lets look at some of the sections you are likely to encounter:

* __NAME__ This section gives the name of the command and simple statement of what it is supposed to do.

* __SYNOPSIS__ This section describes how the command is to be used and the *arguments* it expects. In computer science, an *argument* is the extra information and parameters that the user specifies to a command to modify it's behavior. 
    + [OPTION] This indicates that the first argument you can pass is an optional parameter or flag. The parameters and flags that you can use are listed below under the Description section.
    + `...` This indicates that you can pass more than one of something. In this case, since if follows [OPTIONS], you can pass more than one option.
    + [FILE] This indicates that you could specify a particular file or path to list the contents of
    + `...` Again, this means that you could specify more than one file or path.
    + Note that anything enclosed in braces: `[]` are actually designated as optional arguments. In this case, neither OPTIONS nor FILE need be specified for the command to work.
    
* __DESCRIPTION__ This section gives more details about what the function done and describes in more detail what options are available for you to use. 

Options can be roughly divided into two categories: *flags* and *parameters*

* __flags__ are typically options that you can set to turn certain behaviors on or off. Because they are typically yes/no, they don't require any further arguments. In Linux, flags are set using the minus sign `-` and are typically followed by a letter. You can set multiple flags at once by specifying multiple letters after the `-`. There's often a long form version of flags that is set using the double minus sign `--` followed by a word. The double minus usually distinguishes between a long form flag vs a set of multiple flags.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls
ls -a
ls -l
ls -al
ls --all
```

* __parameters__ are special flags that require some additional arguments. For instance, you could specify the name of an input file or search string. Parameters look like flags, but are usually followed by `=` (or sometimes a space), and parameter value. As above, sometimes the parameter is designated with a word rather than a single letter. In this case, you would usually use a double minus `--`. (Just be aware that the double minus thing isn't a hard fast rule!)
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls --ignore=tools /
```




Because linux is open sourced, software gets contributed from many different programmers. Sometimes, the programmers elect to not include a `man` page. An alternative route is to try the `--help` flag:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls --help
```

As you can see, this returns essentially the same information.

# Homework

For homework, you will continue practice navigating your way around a linux file system using the `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` commands. You will also learn three new commands: `mkdir`, `cp`, and `less` and practice using the associated man files.  


####  <span style="color:blue">__Homework L1: `mkdir`__</span>
Sometimes you will need to make a new directory.  For that there is the `mkdir` command.

1. Navigate to your home directory.

2. Make a new directory called "sandbox" in your home directory:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir sandbox
```

3. We have just illustrated a very important feature of linux: by default linux only talks back to you if you do something wrong. If you give it a correct command that doesn't require the system to give you back any information (such as make a new directory), linux silently obeys. To verify that you succeeded in making a directory, list the contents of your home directory.

4. Navigate into the sandbox directory that you just created.

5. Consult the man page for `mkdir`. Make a new directory inside 'sandbox' called 'myDir' and include a flag in the command that tells `mkdir` to print a message when the directory is created. Use the short form of the flag.

6. Repeat \#5, making a directory inside 'sandbox' called 'yourDir' using the long form of the flag to print a message when the directory is created. List the contents of sandbox to convince yourself that you have successfully created 'myDir' and 'yourDir'. 

7. Navigate back to your home directory. From your home directory, create a new directory inside of sandbox as follows:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir sandbox/ourDir
```

8. Navigate inside the newly created 'ourDir'. Can you do it with a single `cd` command?

9. From within 'ourDir', try to create a nested set of directories: `sharedData/flowData`. What was the result of this operation?

10. Consult the man page for `mkdir` and repeat \#8 using a flag that will tell mkdir to create any parent directories it needs. Also include the flag to tell it to print a message for each created directory.

####  <span style="color:blue">__Homework L2: `cp`__</span>
Often you will need to copy files from one location to another. For that there is the `cp` command.

1. Navigate to the following location: `/tools/sampledata/examples` and list the contents of this directory. This directory contains small example files of many kinds of file formats that you might expect to work with at some point.

2. 









*** 

### Making your own directories. Using __`mkdir`__
A file system isn't any good unless you can make your own directories and organize things the way you like them. For that there is the mkdir command.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir myDir
```








### Using __`mkdir`__

Sometimes you will need to make a new directory.  For that there is the mkdir command.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir myDir
```

### Using __`touch`__

And sometimes you will just need to create an empty file.  Maybe later on you want to write something to it, but right now you just want to reserve that filename. For that you can use the `touch` command. Here we use touch to create a file inside of our new directory:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
touch myDir/test.txt
```

### text editors

Linux is loaded with powerful text editors. Some of them (like vi or emacs) are so powerful that they could each have their own course.  Today lets look at a very simple and common one: `nano`.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
nano myFile.txt
```

That command will launch the nano editor.  Once inside you will be able to type in text of interest.  When you want to leave you can look at the bottom of the screen and you will see commands abbreviated like this: ^X 

`^X` basically means 'CTRL-X'.  It's a hint about how to give that command.  Do it now to exit out of nano and feel free to save your work on the way.

### __Answers for Exercises__

Here you can find answers to the questions posed above.   


##### __Answer for Question L1:__

Display the contents of your home dir:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ~/
ls
```

Find where other home dirs are located:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pwd
cd ..
ls
```

Are you allowed to see other working directories?

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -l
```
No: the permissions prevent this
